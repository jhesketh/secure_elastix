This program is designed to be used in a system that blocks all incoming traffic except for http/s.
The program simply opens up the ports necessary to use SIP thus providing a means of white listing IP's.
The ports open can be changed by editing the $commands array in the authentication.php file.
Place the entire folder into a publically accessible http directory.

When the authenticate.php file is hit the requesting IP gets an exception added into iptables.
Alternatively the IP can be provided through a GET parameter (eg: authenticate.php?auth=token&ip=127.0.0.1)

An auth token needs to be provided as a GET parameter. This should be unique and can be changed in the authentication.php file.

This program is ran as the apache user (eg www-data). As such it is likely authentication is needed to be raised.
Sudo can do this by entering the following rule into the /etc/sudoers file:

www-data    ALL = NOPASSWD: /sbin/iptables

or for elastix:

asterisk    ALL = NOPASSWD: /sbin/iptables
