This program is designed to help secure elastix by running some crude bash commands.
I recommend looking at the source of the program before running it as it is rather
straight forward and it is important to know how it is going to modify the system.

Here is a list of the features and briefly what they do. For more information see
fail2ban, iptables and the README's in the contrib.

Change the default passwords of the following elastix services:
 - Change elastix password
 - Change A2Billing password
 - Change VTiger password (not finished) 
 - Change SugarCMS password (not finished)
 
Move the sshd port (security through obscurity)

Move https port (security through obscurity)

Create site-wide htaccess authentication 
    This adds a layer of security on top of all web services provided. This is quite
    useful as it covers any flaws in elastix, freepbx, fop etc.

Install fail2ban with elastix optimised configuration
    See fail2ban manual. The included configuration is optimised for elastix.
    
Install 'detect_login' - a program that firewalls IP's with large numbers of bad sip registrations
    See contrib README
    (likely redundant with fail2ban)

Firewall all incoming ports except for ssh and https (WARNING!, resets current rules)
    This also clearly blocks SIP traffic. These rules are designed to be used with asterisk_firewalling (see contrib)

Install 'asterisk_firewalling' - a program that whitelists IP's on the firewall
    See contrib README

Allow incoming ICMP requests (ping's)
    A simple firewall exception
